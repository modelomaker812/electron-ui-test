## For My Developers 🖤 🍻

Built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org) to make things **easier on us** && still *just worx!* in 2023.

### Getting Started

Run

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

### Publishing package

```sh
npm run release
```

After Travis finishes building your app, open the release draft it created and click "Publish".

^ Delete everything from here up once packaged! ^ Will also need to setup/configure [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/) ^
